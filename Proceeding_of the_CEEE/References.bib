  abstract = {In this paper, the speed regulation problem for permanent magnet synchronous motor (PMSM) system under vector control framework is studied. First, a speed regulation scheme based on standard internal model control (IMC) method is designed. For the speed loop, a standard internal model controller is first designed based on a first-order model of PMSM by analyzing the relationship between reference quadrature axis current and speed. For the two current loops, PI algorithms are employed respectively. Second, considering the disadvantages that the standard IMC method is sensitive to control input saturation and may lead to poor speed tracking and load disturbance rejection performances, a modified IMC scheme is developed based on a two-port IMC method, where a feedback control term is added to form a composite control structure. Third, considering the case of large variations of load inertia, two adaptive IMC schemes with two different adaptive laws are proposed. A method based on disturbance observer is adopted to identify the inertia of PMSM and its load. Then a linear adaptive law is developed by analyzing the relationship between the internal model and identified inertia. Considering the control input saturation in practical applications, a fuzzy adaptive law based IMC scheme is developed based on apriori experimental tests and experiences, where a fuzzy inferencer based supervisor is designed to automatically tune the parameter of speed controller according to the identified inertia. The effectiveness of the proposed methods have been verified by Matlab simulation and TMS320F2808 DSP experimental results.},

Therefore, this study presents a speed control integrated circuit (IC) for permanent magnet synchronous motor (PMSM) drive under this SoPC environment. First, the mathematic model of PMSM is defined and the vector control used in the current loop of PMSM drive is explained.

After that, an FPGA-based speed control IC is designed to realize the controllers. The proposed speed control IC has two IPs, a Nios II embedded processor IP and an application IP. The Nios II processor is used to develop the adaptive fuzzy controller in software due to the complicated control algorithm and low sampling frequency control (speed control: 2 kHz). The designed application IP is utilized to implement the current vector controller in hardware owing to the requirement for high sampling frequency control (current loop: 16 kHz, pulsewidth modulation circuit: 4-8 MHz) but simple computation.

The PFC-based speed control design consists of two steps. A simplified model is employed to predict the future <i>q</i> -axis current of PMSM. Then, an optimal control law is obtained by minimizing a quadratic performance index. However, it is noted that the standard PFC method does not achieve a satisfying effect in the presence of strong disturbances. To this end, an improved PFC method, called the PFC+ESO method, is developed. It introduces extended state observer (ESO) to estimate the lumped disturbances and adds a feedforward compensation item based on the estimated disturbances to the PFC speed controller. Simulation and experiment comparisons are made for these PFC methods and proportional-integral method with antiwindup control method to verify the effectiveness of the proposed methods.},

  abstract = {Permanent magnet synchronous motors are extensively used in high-performance industrial applications. However, plenty of practical factors (e.g., cogging torques, load torques, friction torques, measurement error effects, dead-time effects, and parameter perturbations) in the closed-loop servo system inevitably bring barriers to the high-performance speed regulation, which can be regarded as generalized disturbances. Most of the existing control approaches only focus on one single kind of disturbances. However, the practical servo system is affected by multiple sources of disturbances simultaneously and these disturbances enter into the system through different channels. To this end, this paper systematically analyzes several representative disturbances, particularly including their features and distribution in the practical servo system, and then, specifically puts forward a novel disturbance rejection framework based on a noncascade structure. Under this framework, a comprehensive disturbance observer is proposed to simultaneously and accurately estimate multiple disturbances such that a composite controller can be designed to correspondingly compensate disturbances. Rigorous analysis of stability is established. Comparative experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves a better speed dynamic response and a higher accuracy tracking performance even in the presence of multiple sources of disturbances.},

The proposed method adopts the speed-current single-loop control structure instead of the traditional cascade control in the vector control of the PMSM. First, considering the nonlinear and the coupling characteristic, a single-loop terminal sliding mode controller is designed for PMSM drive system through feedback linearization technology. This method can make the motor speed and current reach the reference value in finite time, which can realize the fast transient response. Although the SMC is less sensitive to parameter uncertainties and external disturbance, it may produce a large switching gain, which may cause the undesired chattering. Meanwhile, the SMC cannot keep the property of invariance in the presence of unmatched uncertainties. Then, a nonlinear disturbance observer is proposed to the estimate the lump disturbance, which is used in the feed-forward compensation control. Thus, a composite control scheme is developed for the PMSM drive system.

The presence of unknown, time varying, and load-torque inputs, unknown system parameters, and the lack of knowledge of the initial shaft's angular position, prompts a high-gain generalized proportional integral (GPI) observer-based active disturbance rejection (ADR) controller. This controller is synthesized on the basis of the differential flatness of the system and the direct measurability of the system's flat outputs, constituted by the motor's angular displacement and the d-axis current. As a departure from many previous treatments, the d-q-axis currents model is here computed on the basis of the measured displacement and not on the basis of the unknown position. The proposed high-gain GPI observer-based ADR controller is justified in terms of a singular perturbation approach. The validity and robustness of the scheme are verified by means of realistic computer simulations, using the MATLAB/SIMULINK-PSIM package.},

This paper presents a robust hysteresis current-controlled PWM scheme for a magnetic suspended positioning system driven by an inverter-fed linear permanent-magnet synchronous motor having improved performance in these two areas. In the proposed control scheme, the conventional hysteresis PWM mechanism is augmented by a robust harmonic spectrum-shaping controller. The error signal, which represents the switching frequency deviated from the set one, is detected using a notching filter inverse model. Then, the current command is adjusted by a robust compensation signal. The hysteresis band can be equivalently varied to let the dominant harmonic frequency of inverter output be constant, wherein the frequency can easily be changed by tuning the center frequency of the notch filter. The gating signal of switches is not needed to be sensed for making the proposed control. The constant-frequency control performance yielded by the proposed controller is rather insensitive to the system disturbances and the neutral voltage variation due to isolated Y connection. Through applying the proposed PWM inverter, satisfactory position control requirements can be achieved by properly setting the dominant harmonic frequency according to the electromechanical model of the positioning system.},

The new cascaded continuous and finite model predictive control (CCF-MPC) combines two different predictive control algorithms in a cascaded structure. The finite control set approach (FCS-MPC) offers an optimised current control and the continuous control set approach (CCS-MPC) enables an optimal speed control. The cascaded control scheme allows a prediction in dependence on electrical and mechanical time constants. The separation of the time constants offers an optimum between the discrete granularity of the predictive step size and the possible length of the prediction horizon. In this way, a predictive control of the entire mechatronic system is possible. In addition, non-linear and linear equations of the drive system are separated. The results of the proposed method show an optimised current with highly dynamic behaviour in combination with an active damping of oscillations at the mechanical shaft of the drive system, which are beneficial for mechatronic applications.},

  abstract = {This paper presents an efficient direct-model predictive control (EDMPC) technique for surface-mounted permanentmagnet synchronous generators (PMSGs) in variable-speed wind energy conversion systems (WECSs). The proposed control technique is based on directly computing the reference voltage vector (VV) from the demanded currents using a deadbeat (DB) function. Then, a discrete-time integral action (DTIA) is added to this DB function to enhance the robustness of the proposed EDMPC scheme against variations of the machine parameters and to achieve a good steady-state response. The proposed DTIA is simple and easy to implement. Finally, according to the location of this reference VV, two evaluations of the quality function are only required. Accordingly, the proposed EDMPC technique with DTIA overcomes the following drawbacks of the conventional direct-model predictive control (DMPC): i) High calculation burden, ii) sensitivity to parameters mismatches, and iii) non-zero steady-state error. The performance of the proposed EDMPC technique with DTIA has been experimentally investigated and compared with that of the EDMPC with time delay control approach (TDCA) and with the performance of the convention DMPC using a 14:5kW PMSG.},

  abstract = {In this paper, a new sensorless deadbeat control method is proposed. In the deadbeat method, the desired voltage is calculated via the model of the induction motor and inverter (prediction model). This voltage impels the motor to track the references of the torque and flux in the next control interval. Robustness is an important issue about the deadbeat method. Two new techniques are used to reach a robust speed-independent sensorless deadbeat method. A speed-independent model is sued for prediction. Therefore, the estimated speed will not be used in the prediction model. It will reduce the drift error problem. Also, a new adaptive predictive method is proposed for simultaneous estimation of the stator resistance and speed. Only direct-axis equation is used in the adaptive method. This will reduce the calculation burden. The new adaptive function is achieved via the Lyapunov technique. The stability of the multiple-input multiple-output system for simultaneous adaptation is analyzed for the gain design problem. Simulation and experimental results in wide range of speed are depicted in order to verify the proposed method.},

Major problems of such control schemes are the delay of the discrete control system, machine parameter uncertainties and measurement noise. With conventional methods, the delay can be easily compensated, but the effects of uncertainties can only be handled when they are comparably slow. This paper presents a new filtering method that attenuates the negative effects of parameter uncertainties in fast transients. The predictive controller inputs are actual measurements averaged with previous current predictions. As a result, the stability range is extended, and the oscillations caused by parameter uncertainties are damped. Noise sensitivity is also reduced. The system response is not slowed down. The results are confirmed analytically and experimentally.},

  abstract = {In order to optimize the current-control performance of the permanent-magnet synchronous motor (PMSM) system with model parameter mismatch and one-step control delay, an improved deadbeat predictive current control (DPCC) algorithm for the PMSM drive systems is proposed in this paper. First, the performance of the conventional predictive current control, when parameter mismatch exist, is analyzed, and then a stator current and disturbance observer (SCDO) based on sliding-mode exponential reaching law, which is able to simultaneously predict future value of stator current and track system disturbance caused by parameter mismatch in real time, is proposed. Based on this SCDO, prediction currents are used for replacing the sampled current in DPCC to compensate one-step delay, and estimated parameter disturbances are considered as the feedforward value to compensate the voltage reference calculated by deadbeat predictive current controller. Thus, a composite control method combining the DPCC part and current prediction and feedforward compensation part based on SCDO, called DPCC + SCDO method, is developed. Moreover, based on conventional exponential reaching law, a novel sliding-mode exponential reaching law is proposed to further improve the performance of the DPCC + SCDO method. Simulation and experimental results both show the validity of the proposed current control approach.},

The predictive control is a flexible method to control different variables through the minimization of a cost function. In drive system, the predictive control can be divided to predictive current control (PCC) and predictive torque control (PTC). In PCC, the stator current is evaluated in cost function, but in PTC the torque and stator flux are evaluated in the cost function. On the other hand, the ability of matrix converter in control of input source current can be easily included in both PCC and PTC. This paper introduces the methodology and the results of a comprehensive comparison of PCC and PTC techniques for a permanent-magnet synchronous motor (PMSM) fed by a matrix converter. The comparison involves the investigation of the torque and stator flux ripples, the total harmonic distortion of input and output currents, and the input filter resonance as figures of merit. Different performance indicators that present an instruction for the selection of predictive control methods for PMSM drive applications by matrix converters for engineering practices are provided with this comparative evaluation.},

  abstract = {High-level synthesis (HLS)-based design methodologies are extremely viable for industries that are sensitive to production costs. In order to have competitive advantage, the ability to have several different implementations of the same algorithm satisfying a diverse range of resolution, cost, and performance constraints is highly desirable. In this paper, we present multiple hardware implementations of the semi-global matching (SGM) algorithm, which is used in stereo vision systems, e.g., for automotive applications. The hardware platform considered in this paper is a Xilinx Zynq system-on-chip. A performance comparison of both HLS-based design and a manual register transfer level (RTL) design in terms of quality of results, flexibility, and design time is also presented. SGM mainly includes a sequence of three processing steps, i.e., the “cost cube calculation” followed by the “path cost computation” and finally the “disparity approximation and minimization”. The path cost processor further performs a pixel-wise processing of the cost cube data along eight distinct path orientations. The baseline algorithmic model usually called the “golden” model utilizes considerably large arrays that are required to be mapped to an external DRAM and brought into the on-chip RAM when required. This necessitates adding both the memory transfer loops as well as insertion of calls to the AXI transactors for accessing the DRAM through the on-chip DDR slave. Furthermore, the initial algorithm (typically single-threaded) must be parallelized to fully exploit the concurrency offered by the target hardware platform. The design space exploration was thus performed by making several considerably different micro-architectural choices. Eventually, we were able to obtain an implementation comparable with the manual RTL design. Both the manual RTL and the HLS designs achieved the target real-time performance of 30 frames/s for the image resolution of 640×480 with a disparity depth of 128 pixels per frame.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a comparative study of two predictive speed control schemes for induction machine (IM) in terms of their design and performance. The first control scheme is finite control set-model predictive control (FCS-MPC) with modulation control and the second control scheme is continuous control set-model predictive control (CCS-MPC) with space vector-pulse width modulation. The two schemes adopt the cascaded control approach, which consists of an inner MPC loop for torque control and outer MPC loop for speed control using two individual cost functions. The outer MPC produces the required torque to drive the IM at the reference speed while the reference torque is taken as the input of the inner MPC, which in turn generates control signals for the inverter. The control states of the two MPCs are constrained with the maximum limits of the drive system. The state feedback is achieved with a standard Kalman filter, which estimates the nonmeasured load torque. For a fair comparison, both approaches are applied to the same IM at the same operational circumstances. The control approaches are implemented and validated in an experimental environment using the same sampling frequency on the same test bench (3.7 kW IM drive). The behavior of the control approaches is assessed by applying reference and disturbance steps to the system in different operational modes. Comparison of the predictive schemes leads to the conclusion that the both MPC approaches achieve similar performances. However, the CCS-MPC scheme has a smaller current ripple and is of low computational complexity. The computing duration is not very different for the three tested schemes.

  abstract = {An analysis of the state-observer-based robust speed control of a self-controlled synchronous motor (SCSM) is presented. A variable-structure control technique is utilized to achieve robust (parameter-insensitive) characteristics. The speed and acceleration signals required for the implementation of the variable-structure speed control (VSSC) are dynamically estimated with state observers. Two kinds of observers-the Luenberger full-order observer and an adaptive observer-are explored. The results obtained illustrate that Luenberger observers do not estimate the system states accurately when the system parameters vary. This inaccuracy in the state estimation results in a deterioration of the VSSC performance. Therefore, the possibility of using an adaptive state observer (ASO) is investigated. It is shown that the ASO estimates the system parameters and the system states simultaneously, thus making VSSC possible. The design methods and simulation results are presented to demonstrate the potential of the scheme.<>},

  abstract = {A high-order switching surface for boundary control of inverters is presented in this paper. The concept is based on using the natural response of the power stage to formulate a logarithmic function to approximate the ideal switching surface. With the proposed control method, the inverter exhibits better dynamic responses than the ones with the first-order or recently proposed second-order switching surfaces. It will also be shown that the first- order and second-order switching surfaces are the low-order approximations of high-order switching surface. As the high-order switching surface is close to the ideal switching surface, its high trajectory velocity along the switching surface makes the inverter state trajectory move toward the steady-state operating point in two switching actions under large-signal disturbances. The effects of the parametric variations on the output voltage and the large- signal characteristics of the inverter will be discussed. The proposed control method has been successfully applied to a 300-W, 110-V, 60-Hz, single-phase full-bridge inverter. The steady-state and large-signal dynamic behaviors of the inverter supplying to resistive, nonlinear inductive, and full-wave rectifier loads will be given.},

To solve these problems, this paper proposes static-errorless DPCC using a second-order sliding-mode disturbance observer (DO). The IM parameter variation and other unmodeled dynamics are regarded as lump disturbance in the modeling of IM. Based on this model, a second-order sliding-mode DO is constructed to estimate lump disturbance, and then the estimated disturbance is applied as feed-forward compensation to correct the steady state current error. Moreover, the designed second-order sliding-mode DO effectively alleviates the chattering effect caused by the switching control. Since the designed DO works in parallel with the DPCC, the fast dynamic responses of the DPCC is retained. Experimental results confirmed the validity of the proposed scheme.},

In this method, by considering the sign of the error between stator-current components and their corresponding reference values, two AVVs are selected. Then, the changes of stator-current components due to applying these AVVs are formulated. At the next step, duty-cycles of these AVVs are calculated such that deadbeat control of the stator-current components is achieved. To improve the efficiency of the proposed DB-DCC method, reference stator-current components are adjusted based on the principle of maximum-torque-per-ampere, while the ZVV is selected such that the minimum switching transition occurs in each control cycle. Performance of the proposed method is assessed in MATLAB software and in practice where the results indicate that the proposed method reduces the stator-current total harmonic distortion in the steady-state and improves the dynamic response of the motor in the transient-state.

  abstract = {Conventional model predictive current control (MPCC) applies only one vector during one control period, which produces large torque and flux ripples and high current harmonics in permanent magnet synchronous motor (PMSM) drives. Recently MPCC with duty cycle control has been proposed to improve the steady state performance by applying one non-zero vector and one null vector during one control period. However, the prior method requires lots of calculations and predictions to find the optimal voltage vectors and calculate their respective duration. Different from prior enumeration-based MPCC, this paper proposes an efficient two-vector MPCC by applying two arbitrary voltage vectors during one control period. The reference voltage vector is firstly calculated based on the principle of deadbeat current control. Two optimal vectors and their duration are then obtained in a very efficient way, which does not require the calculation of current slopes in prior MPCC methods. The proposed method is compared to the state-of-the-art predictive control methods, including conventional MPCC, MPCC with duty cycle control, deadbeat control with space vector modulation (SVM) and modulated model predictive control (M2PC). Both simulation and experimental results prove that the proposed method achieves better steady state performance than conventional MPCC with or without duty cycle and the dynamic response is not degraded. Under the condition of insufficient dc bus voltage, the proposed method outperforms deadbeat control and M2PC by presenting even higher speed range and less torque ripples.},

However, it also has two drawbacks that could be improved. First, the torque reference in the cost function of the existing PTC method is generated by the proportional-integral speed controller, so torque reference's generation rate is not fast and its accuracy is low especially when the load torque is given suddenly and inertia value is varying. In addition, the variable prediction of the traditional PTC method depends on the system model, which also has the problem of parameter uncertainties. This paper investigates a disturbance observer (DOB)-based PTC approach for induction motor systems subject to load torque disturbances, parameter uncertainties, and time delays. Not only does the speed loop adopt a DOB-based feed-forward compensation method for improving the system disturbance rejection ability and robustness, but the flux, current, and torque predictions are also improved by using this technique.

  abstract = {Active disturbance rejection control (ADRC) can be summarized as follows: it inherits from proportional-integral-derivative (PID) the quality that makes it such a success: the error driven, rather than model-based, control law; it takes from modern control theory its best offering: the state observer; it embraces the power of nonlinear feedback and puts it to full use; it is a useful digital control technology developed out of an experimental platform rooted in computer simulations. ADRC is made possible only when control is taken as an experimental science, instead of a mathematical one. It is motivated by the ever increasing demands from industry that requires the control technology to move beyond PID, which has dominated the practice for over 80 years. Specifically, there are four areas of weakness in PID that we strive to address: 1) the error computation; 2) noise degradation in the derivative control; 3) oversimplification and the loss of performance in the control law in the form of a linear weighted sum; and 4) complications brought by the integral control. Correspondingly, we propose four distinct measures: 1) a simple differential equation as a transient trajectory generator; 2) a noise-tolerant tracking differentiator; 3) the nonlinear control laws; and 4) the concept and method of total disturbance estimation and rejection. Together, they form a new set of tools and a new way of control design. Times and again in experiments and on factory floors, ADRC proves to be a capable replacement of PID with unmistakable advantage in performance and practicality, providing solutions to pressing engineering problems of today. With the new outlook and possibilities that ADRC represents, we further believe that control engineering may very well break the hold of classical PID and enter a new era, an era that brings back the spirit of innovations.},

  abstract = {In high-performance control of ac machines through variable frequency drives, the knowledge of machine parameters plays a decisive role. The accuracy with which machine parameters can be known is directly related to the time and effort put during the testing and commissioning process. In the ever-demanding industrial environments, the time spent on parameter identification translates into loss of production. To reduce commissioning times, research in this direction has focused on automatizing the identification procedure without loss of accuracy. This paper reviews different lines of research adopted over the past few decades for machine parameter identification. Parameter estimation of ac machines is considered because of their widespread applications from servomechanisms to traction to aviation. The surveyed works include self-commissioning schemes that have become an integral part and a salient feature of modern electric drives. This feature enables the drives to automatically identify machine parameters and tune the control loops.},
